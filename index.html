    <h1>Why You Should Drink Water</h1>
    <p>
      Drinking water is one of the best things you can do for your body. 
      Especially with summer approaching, it is important that you drink enough water so that you can avoid dehydration,
      which is a condition that causes negative mood changes, overheating, unclear thinking, and more. 
      So, kids, remember to drink your water!

    <h3>Tips to drink more water</h3>
    <p>
      - Keep a water bottle near you at all times.
      <br />
      - If you absolutely hate drinking water, try adding a wedge of lemon or lime into it. (It makes the water sweeter)
      <br />
      - Set hourly reminders to get up and drink some water.
